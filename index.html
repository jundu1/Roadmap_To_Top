Just months ahead of China’s biggest political gathering, how it selects its top leaders seems mysterious to many but is, as always, thoroughly intriguing.
<br ><br >
Will the succession of Xi Jinping – the man in line to take over Hu Jintao’s twin roles as party chief and president, the power structure falls into two distinct coalitions. One group is usually called Populists (Tuanpai). The other group is known as the Elitists. 
<br ><br >
Will more lawyers, instead of engineers, as in the previous government, dominate what observers regard as the fifth generation of China’s leaders? If so, will that affect the political clout of the so-called Tsinghua Clique. 
<br ><br >
Will a doctorate or overseas experience help a contender to get fast promotions? Otherwise, why do some provincial governments spare no effort to send their officials abroad for training? 
<br ><br >
Will more democratic party members join the fifth generation of leaders? Is it true that those people get faster promotion than communist party members? 
<br ><br >
Researchers from the Journalism and Media Studies Center at The University of Hong Kong (JMSC) dug into the background data of 404 leaders in China  who are currently holding a position higher than the deputy ministerial level. Researchers tried to identify patterns by looking at how those leaders were promoted over the past 40 years. The data-mining results cast doubts on some myths about China’s politics and backed up some unspoken beliefs. 
<br ><br >
What’s more, the statistical findings reveal some connections between some key historical events.
