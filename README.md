I worked with my colleagues from the Journalism and Media Studies Center at The University of Hong Kong (JMSC) and dug into the background data of 404 leaders in China  who are currently holding a position higher than the deputy ministerial level. Researchers tried to identify  patterns by looking at how those leaders were promoted over the past 40 years. The data-mining results cast doubts on some myths about China’s politics and backed up some unspoken beliefs. What’s more, the statistical findings reveal some connectionsbetween some key historical events.
